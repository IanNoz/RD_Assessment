# RD_Assessment

##Front end develpment assesment By Ian Noziglia

This is the implementation of the design provided for the assesment:
* I tried to remain loyal to the original design, including image slider and dropdown menus, adding only a few animations.
* Other than JQuery, no externals libraries has been used.
* The implementation adapts well to different computer and tablets screens sizes.
* it includes as well a Mobile Screen adaptation.
